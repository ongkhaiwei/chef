This cookbook installs IBM Installation Manager (IM) and provides lightweight resource/providers (LWRPs) that can be used to install IBM products using the IBM Installation Manager. You can use the iim_name_install LWRP to install the package using the default configuration options, or you can have full control over the configuration of your installation by using the iim_response_file_install LWRP with a response file that defines your configuration.
